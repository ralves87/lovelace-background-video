## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The **Lovelace Background Video** module can be configured in the **`ui-lovelace.yaml`** file (YAML mode) or directly in the **Lovelace graphical editor**.

---

### Basic Example

Add the basic configuration to your `ui-lovelace.yaml` file:

```yaml
background_video:
  default_url: "/local/community/lovelace-background-video/default-background.mp4"
```
### Advanced Configuration

Here is a complete configuration example::

```yaml
background_video:
  default_url: "/local/community/lovelace-background-video/default-background.mp4"
  opacity: 0.8  # Default video opacity (0.0 to 1.0)
  views:
    - path: "home"
      config:
        default_url: "/local/community/lovelace-background-video/home-background.mp4"
        opacity: 0.5  # Specific opacity for the "home" view
        entity: "sensor.weather_state"  # Sensor that controls the background state
        state_url:
          sunny: "/local/community/lovelace-background-video/sunny.mp4"  # Background for "sunny" state
          rainy: "/local/community/lovelace-background-video/rainy.mp4"  # Background for "rainy" state
    - path: "dashboard"
      config:
        default_url: "/local/community/lovelace-background-video/dashboard-background.mp4"
        opacity: 0.7  # Specific opacity for the "dashboard" view
```

## üìñ Configuration Options

### Global Options
Global options are defined directly under `background_video` and apply to all views unless overridden.

| Property          | Type     | Default | Description                                                               |
|-------------------|----------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default_url`     | `string` | -       | Path to the default video or image used as the background.                |
| `opacity`         | `number` | 1.0     | Sets the video opacity. Values range from `0.0` (transparent) to `1.0`.   |

---

### View-Specific Options
You can configure specific backgrounds for each **view** in Lovelace.

| Property            | Type       | Default  | Description                                                               |
|---------------------|------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `path`              | `string`   | -        | The view‚Äôs path in Lovelace (usually visible in the URL).                 |
| `config.default_url`| `string`   | -        | Path to the specific video or image for this view.                        |
| `config.opacity`    | `number`   | 1.0      | Specific opacity for the background of this view.                         |
| `config.entity`     | `string`   | -        | Entity that controls the background state.                                |
| `config.state_url`  | `object`   | -        | A dictionary mapping entity states to specific URLs.                      |

---

### Example of `state_url`

You can configure different backgrounds based on an entity‚Äôs state. For example:

```yaml
state_url:
  sunny: "/local/community/lovelace-background-video/sunny.mp4"
  rainy: "/local/community/lovelace-background-video/rainy.mp4"
  cloudy: "/local/community/lovelace-background-video/cloudy.mp4"
```

### Explanation:
When the configured entity (e.g., sensor.weather_state) is in the state sunny, the video sunny.mp4 will be displayed. You can map as many states as needed.
